Project Brief: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
 Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 
The task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria

Key Questions
-The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders
-They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
-Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
